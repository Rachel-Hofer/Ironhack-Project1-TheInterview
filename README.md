            -   Deployed
            -   Can play the full game all the way through
        2. Good balance between design and functionality focus
        3. Good "game plan"/organization of the process
    
    Areas of Opportunity:
        1.  Organize your JS better:
            -   Don't write so much code inside of the logic, instead create functions OR methods/classes for what you want the logic to do, to make logic shorter/more organized/easier to read.
    
    Brainstorming Ideas for Project 2:

    Closet App:
        "store" photos of ever item of clothing in your digital closet
        use it to pick out outfits
        use it to manage your clothing "inventory"
        use it to track when you wear what
